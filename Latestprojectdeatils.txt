Proximity Identification using IOT

So nowadays most of the COMMON APLLIANCES we use are smart devices.
These devices communicate with other devices using bluetooth mostly.
the drawback of this is bluetooth consumes more battery and is not required
 for devices where very less data is transmitted.so we proposed a approach with ble 
 where the location of the iot device is calculated by the strength of the ble wave it is emitting.
 that value is called rssi value and it stands for received strength indicator.with help of this we can 
 know which iot device is closest to us.this has many applications,lets imagine a scenario 
 where we are going back to your house after a long day.we can use a ble trigger 
 which automatically switches on the lights,open garage doors.the trigger being a certain strength of ble wave is emitted from our car.
